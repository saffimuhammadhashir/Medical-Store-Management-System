# Medical Store Management System

This project is a comprehensive Medical Store Management System developed in C++, leveraging advanced Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) to efficiently manage and organize medical inventory, transactions, and customer data.

## Key Features
- **Inventory Management**: Efficiently manage medicine stock using Arrays and Linked Lists, allowing for quick access, insertion, and deletion of records.
- **Search & Retrieval**: Implement AVL Trees and Hashing for fast and balanced searching of medicine data, ensuring quick retrieval of necessary information.
- **Customer & Transaction Tracking**: Use Graphs to model relationships between customers and their purchase history, aiding in personalized service and targeted sales strategies.
- **File Handling**: Robust file handling techniques to store, retrieve, and update data, ensuring data persistence and integrity.

## Project Structure
- **Data Structures**: Utilizes a combination of Arrays, Linked Lists, AVL Trees, Graphs, and Hashing to optimize various operations.
- **Algorithms**: Implements efficient algorithms to handle data insertion, deletion, and retrieval tasks.
- **File Management**: Ensures secure and consistent data storage using C++ file handling methods.
This project is an excellent example of applying theoretical DSA concepts in a real-world scenario, providing a functional system to manage a medical store's daily operations with optimized performance and reliability.
